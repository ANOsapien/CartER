The setup I had been working on is currently functioning well; however, the three newly assembled systems still require proper motor tuning to achieve optimal performance.</p>"},{"location":"articles/presentation/","title":"Presentation","text":""},{"location":"articles/presentation/#presentation","title":"Presentation","text":"<p>Here is the final presentation I gave before leaving </p>"},{"location":"assembly/","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"assembly/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Here are a summary of steps to be performed to attach the swing-up mechanism to the already existing cartpole rig setup</p>"},{"location":"assembly/bom/","title":"Assembling","text":""},{"location":"assembly/bom/#assembling","title":"Assembling","text":"<p>All CAD files and components are mentioned in CAD files and Components directories</p>"},{"location":"assembly/bom/#mechanical-connections","title":"Mechanical Connections","text":"<p>Step 1: Center the cart</p> <p>Step 2: Stick the slab protector under the bench around proximity of the centered point</p> <p>Step 3: Attach the clamp on the protector, with the help of M6 nuts and bolts</p> <p>Step 4: Now, connect the clamp to base through two M6 screws, which in extension conncets the vertical board as well (You can add equal number of washers on each screw to control the distance between the vertical board and clamp)</p> <p>Step 5: Take the pendulum rod, and attach the elctromagnet grove on it</p> <p>Step 6: Now, attach the servo motor in the gap on the vertical board with the help of smaller M6 screws (The area is tight enough to work without the screws even)</p> <p>Step 7: Now attach the rotation shaft of motor on the pendulum rod at nearly the 3rd hole from the top, such that it is in line with the original pole.
