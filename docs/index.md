# Introduction

CartER [_Cartpole Environment for Reinforcement learning_] is an open-source learning platform that enables the user to quickly
start experimenting with simulated and physical multi-agent reinforcement learning
projects.

CartER is still being actively developed and uses different strategies for balancing a cartpole ranging from state-of-the-art
reinforcement-learning libraries to control theory for greater reproducibility.


This documentation describes the additional component developed to achieve a fully automated setup and enable data analysis across different PID parameter sets. My 2025 summer internhip work is based on the project accomplished by [Zhen and Owen](https://github.com/Zzzzhen1/Funky_Pendulum) during 2023 summer

## Author

This is the continuation of the CartER projects undertaken by [Jeppe](https://github.com/JeppeKlitgaard/CartER/) and [Will](https://github.com/will-hd/CartER).

The CartER project is an undergraduate research project at the Biological and Soft Systems group at Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge under supervision of Professor Pietro Cicuta.

## Documentation overview

It is divided into a number of categories:

- __Development__: Documentation surrounding the development of the project.  
    Useful for advanced use or further development of the platform.
- __Assembly__: Documentation on acquiring hardware, 3D-printing parts, and assemblying the project.
- __Articles__: A collection of articles related to the project.
- __Videos__: A collection of videos of the project in action.
