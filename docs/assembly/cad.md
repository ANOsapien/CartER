# CAD Files

The CAD has been done in Autodesk Fusion 360, which is unfortunately not very
easy to share in an open-source friendly manner.


If you are interested in the project, please reach out at [ananyapriyaroop@iitb.ac.in](mailto:ananyapriyaroop@iitb.ac.in) in order to get access to the CAD files through Autodesk Cloud.
